Steps to enable Google calendar and contacts sync on omni microg builds

Starting from clean flash (or just fastboot -w)

ATTENTION: In case you update and you have your own Google Contacts Sync apk
in place handle that accordingly. Omni will ship its apk in
/system/app/GoogleContactsSyncAdapter/GoogleContactsSyncAdapter.apk

Note: On every first clean start omni will disable the apk so it does
not affect people that want to go without using google services.
So again in case you have your own be aware of that.

Open Settings app

-Open app permisisons for microG Services Core and enable spoof package signature
-Open app permisisons for FakeStore and enable spoof package signature

Open microG app

-Open Self-Check and control that all spoofing checkboxes are on
-Add google account

Open Settings app

-Open app permisisons for Google Contacts Sync and press enable
 (While you are there double check contacts permissions - should be enabled already)
-Open google account settings enter Account sync and make sure sync for contacts is checked
 (Check for any Permission required notification and allow)
-Check that sync is sucessful

Now you can open Contacts app and your contacts should be available
